# Snake-Game
Making the classic snake game using turtle on python  
Just run the main.py file for the game to start running.  
The head of the snake is red in color, and the food to be eaten is blue in color.   
The body of the snake is white and grows in length after eating food.  
Touching the boundry or the snake itself will result in game over.
